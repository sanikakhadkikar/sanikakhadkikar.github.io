			<h2>Eccentricities in Gravitational Wave Binaries</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
			Recently, I have noticed increased discussion on the importance of eccentricity in the gravitational wave (GW) compact object coalescence literature. However, I lack intuition for why eccentricity is considered significant, for the following reasons:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The orbits circularize (\( e \to 0 \)) as the compact binary approaches coalescence due to gravitational wave emission. So why include eccentricity at all stages?</li>
				<li>The eccentricities of binary neutron star (BNS) systems formed through isolated binary evolution channels are expected to be small (\( e < 0.3 \)), as shown in \cite{Ihm:2005tw}. Dynamically formed binaries contribute only a small fraction of the total BNS population.</li>
				<li>The orbital period does not depend on eccentricity. To explore this, I begin by revisiting the basics of orbital dynamics.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
			The Lagrangian for a two-body system in the center-of-mass frame is:
			</p>

			<p>
			$$
			\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\mu\dot{r}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\mu r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			Here, \( \mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \) is the reduced mass. Since \( \theta \) is a cyclic coordinate, we have:
			</p>

			<p>
			$$
			\mu r^2 \dot{\theta} = \ell
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			And the radial equation of motion becomes:
			</p>

			<p>
			$$
			\mu \ddot{r} = \frac{\ell^2}{\mu r^3} - \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			Using the substitution \( u = \frac{1}{r} \), the solution is a conic:
			</p>

			<p>
			$$
			r(\theta) = \frac{\ell^2}{\mu^2 GM (1 + e \cos\theta)}
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			Here \( M = m_1 + m_2 \) and \( e \) is the orbital eccentricity. The orbital radius \( r \) depends on \( e \), but the period \( T \) is independent of it for bound orbits. By Kepler's second law:
			</p>

			<p>
			$$
			\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{\ell}{2\mu} = \text{constant}
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			Integrating over a full orbit:
			$$
			A = \frac{\ell T}{2\mu}
			$$
			and for an ellipse:
			$$
			A = \pi a b = \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}
			$$

			From the conic solution:
			$$
			a(1 - e^2) = \frac{\ell^2}{\mu^2 GM}
			$$

			Combining these results:
			$$
			T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
			$$
			</p>

			<p>
			This is Kepler’s third law, which confirms that the period \( T \) is independent of eccentricity.
			</p>

			<p>
			My skepticism about the emphasis on eccentricity is rooted in these points. However, the inclusion of gravitational radiation may alter this picture. I will explore this further in future work.
